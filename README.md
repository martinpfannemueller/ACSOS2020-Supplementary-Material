REACT allows domain experts to make their systems adaptive in an easy-to-use manner. REACT uses [Clafer](https://www.clafer.org/) in version 0.4.5 available [here](https://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions.html). A documentation wiki of Clafer can be found [here](http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8091/).

[Here](Configuration_File_Options.md) you can find all available configration file options of REACT.

Everything has been executed and tested using Ubuntu 18.04.
