# Host4: Mininet Wifi

Host4 runs Mininet Wifi. `handover.py` contains the entire setup of the emulated network including the virtual car sensor. For connecting the sensor to REACT, the IDL bindings named `Manta_ice.py` with the corresponding folder `Manta` are used. `run.sh` is the shell script which was used for executing the evaluation runs on the machine with Mininet Wifi installed.

For the evaluation Mininet Wifi with commit hash `411f1a7dbdf8106fac78a337e32384e480804157` was used.
